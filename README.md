# This website is my exam for the Digital Technologies in the Humanities course. 

On this GitHub page you can find 3 folders. 

Exercise 1 and 2 contain the HTML and CSS files of the websited we did during the course work. One of them kind of broke in the process and is not very functional, but i used both of them as reference for certain parts like displaying an image or using java script. 

In the "Actual Website" folder you can find the final project, consisting of 11 Markdown files, 99 Images, 3 HTML files and 1 CSS file. 

You can load this page by hosting it yourself on a programme like VS Code or through Github Pages.
