# European Studies 

## What is European Studies

European Studies focuses on the political, cultural, and historical aspects of Europe and the European Union. The different courses and modules introduce multiple topic areas relevant to the study, such as EU Borders, EU Identity, EU Institutions, and current issues.

## Why did I choose this study course?

### Background 

In German high schools, you have to choose two intensive courses that make up the largest share of your education and grading. I chose Social Sciences and English as they represent my interests and skills the best. Within social sciences, my favourite topics were always those regarding international politics. Political bodies like the UN and the EU were always of the highest interest to me, which is why I decided to focus my further studies on this area. For my Bachelor's, I studied International Relations and wrote my thesis on the voting behaviour of certain states in the EU Council. To further intensify my skills and knowledge in this field, I decided to continue by doing a Master's degree in European Studies afterwards. 

### Ambitions 

While I do not have a clear vision of what I want to do after finishing my Master's, I definitely want to stay in the realm of European Politics. Right now, my favourite thing to do is Policy Analysis and the handling and creation of quantitative data. Unfortunately, I also do not have the most work experience yet, so I have not really figured out yet, what I want/do not want for my professional career. 

## Current topics in the Field of European Studies

My personal fields of interests are populism, democratic backsliding and migration. Luckily for me, I will not be running out of issues to research any time soon. All over Europe, populists are growing stronger and democracies are under attack. Most recently I was looking into migration and it's effect on security and safety as this is one of the topics.
