# What is European Studies 

## A quick introduction
European Studies is an **interdisciplinary** field of study, combining political science, sociology, history, economics, law, and cultural studies. Compared to similar study programmes like International Relations, European Studies **focuses on Europe** and the European Union, as its name suggests. It examines Europe from multiple angles, spanning from European ideas and visions to the present political and social reality. It discusses important questions like European integration, identity, governance, and Europe’s global role that contribute to our understanding of how Europe shapes, and is shaped by dynamics within and beyond its borders.

## Origins
European Studies emerged in the **mid-20th century** alongside the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) which was the first cornerstone in European cooperation after WWII. The ECSC project would also evolve over the next decades to become the European Union we know today. Initially the academic field focused on the understanding of **European integration and EU institutions** but over time it expanded its scope, including important topics like Europeanization, nationalism, regionalism, and external relations. 

## Core Research Themes
The research in the field of European Studies is as vast as the many disciplines that shape it. This section will only list a couple of them to grant an overview: 
+ **European Identity**: How is it constructed and contested? Who belongs to Europe and who doesn't? What does it mean to be European?
+ **EU Governance**: What role does the EU play in governing its member states? How does the EU affect regional policy-making? Is the EU an effective and legitimate policy-making instituion?
+ **EU's Global Role**: How does Europe interact with it's neighbours? What role does the EU have as a global actor? What shapes the EU's external relations with other parts of the globe? 
+ **Challenges**: Exploration of multiple challenges and crises on topics like Migration, Climate Change, Economic Challenges, Democratic Backsliding

## Key Takeaways 
European Studies is a vast and diverse field of study exploring Europe in its various dimensions. It started out with focusing on European Integration and the EU institutions, but it also keeps evolving together with Europe itself. Today, issues of migration, climate change and economic backsliding are on top of the agenda, that are being explored by great minds from various backgrounds and academic fields.
