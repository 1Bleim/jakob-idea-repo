# Inserting Pictures and Links

This was pretty straightforward. On [markdownguide.org](markdownguide.org), I found some useful functions that allow me to include pictures and also directly link to my sources in the markdown file. 

For the pictures specifically, I first take the file and save it in a folder of my project. In my case, I just created an extra folder for all pictures. To then load the picture when the markdown file is displayed, I used the following function ![alt text](path of the image)
For the links, the function is quite similar: ["text that will be marked"](link to the website). 

Here is an example. The picture below is being loaded with this function ![Silly Cat on a Skateboard] (images/skateboarding-cat.gif) with the space between the brackets and parantheses removed.
