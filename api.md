# Implementation of an API

For the implementation of the API I only used the available course material on Brightspace. I decided to go for the [Random Cat Fact](https://catfact.ninja/fact) API. I then copied the function to fetch data from an API on Brightspace into my < script> section. I then changed "getAdvice" to "getFact" and adjusted the *link*, *ElementID*, and *inner HTML*. This is what the final function in my < script> part looks like: ![API Script Section](images/api.jpg)

I then added the < h2 id="fact">< /h2> function in my header on the landingpage. I also gave it the < h2> tag to make it stand out a bit more in the final product.
